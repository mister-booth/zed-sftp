[![Zed Extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zed-Extension-blue)](https://zed.dev)

This is a Zed extension for SFTP file synchronization, inspired by the popular [vscode-sftp](https://github.com/Natizyskunk/vscode-sftp) extension.

## ✨ Features

- **Upload on Save** - Automatically upload files when you save them
- **Manual Upload/Download** - Upload or download files and folders on demand
- **Sync Folders** - Synchronize entire directories between local and remote
- **Multiple Profiles** - Support for multiple server configurations
- **Ignore Patterns** - Exclude files and folders from sync (like .git, node_modules)
- **SSH Key Authentication** - Secure authentication with SSH keys
- **Password Authentication** - Support for password-based authentication

## 🚀 How It Works

This extension uses a **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** approach to watch for file changes and trigger uploads. When you save a file in Zed, the language server detects the save event and automatically uploads the file to your configured SFTP server.

The language server is written in Node.js/TypeScript and uses the `ssh2-sftp-client` library for SFTP operations, providing the same functionality as vscode-sftp.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Rust** - Required to compile the extension to WebAssembly
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   # After installation, add WebAssembly target:
   rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
   ```

2. **Node.js** - Required for the language server (v18 or later)
   ```bash
   brew install node  # macOS
   # Or download from https://nodejs.org/
   ```

3. **Zed Editor** - Latest version recommended

### Install Extension

1. Open Zed
2. Open Extensions view: `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Linux/Windows)
3. Search for "SFTP"
4. Click "Install"

Or install as dev extension:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/andreyc0d3r/zed-sftp
cd zed-sftp

# Run setup script (checks dependencies and builds)
./setup.sh

# Or build manually:
cd server && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cargo build --release

# Install in Zed: Extensions > Install Dev Extension > Select this directory
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.zed/sftp.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "name": "My Server",
  "protocol": "sftp",
  "host": "example.com",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "user",
  "remotePath": "/var/www/html",
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "ignore": [
    ".git",
    "node_modules",
    ".zed"
  ]
}
```

### Authentication Options

**SSH Key (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "username": "user",
  "privateKeyPath": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
  "passphrase": "$SFTP_PASSPHRASE"
}
```

**Password (use env-var form to keep secrets out of the config file):**
```json
{
  "username": "user",
  "password": "$SFTP_PASSWORD"
}
```

Then set the variable before launching Zed:
```bash
SFTP_PASSWORD='your-password' zed .
```

A literal password in the config (e.g. `"password": "hunter2"`) works but
the file will contain the secret in plaintext. `.zed/sftp.json` is in
`.gitignore` by default — see [Security](#security) below for details.

### Host Key Verification (Required)

To prevent MITM attacks, the extension **refuses to connect** unless the
server's host key can be verified. Get your server's fingerprint once and pin
it in your config:

```bash
# Capture the fingerprint (run once, on a trusted network)
ssh-keyscan -t ed25519,rsa,ecdsa your-server.com | ssh-keygen -lf -
# Output looks like:
#   # Host your-server.com found: line 1
#   |1|abc...|ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3...
# Pick the line WITHOUT the "|1|" prefix, e.g.:
#   ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... your-server.com
# Run it through ssh-keygen to get the SHA256 fingerprint:
#   ssh-keygen -lf <(echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3...")
#   256 SHA256:pE4q7Y/...base64... your-server.com (ED25519)
```

Then add the `SHA256:` line to your config:

```json
{
  "host": "your-server.com",
  "hostKey": "SHA256:pE4q7Y/...base64..."
}
```

If you have an existing `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, you can point the extension at
it instead via `"knownHostsPath": "~/.ssh/known_hosts"`.

To explicitly disable verification (NOT recommended — only for trusted local
networks / testing), set `"verifyHostKey": false`. A warning is logged on
every connection.

### Security

**Don't commit secrets.** The config file may contain passwords or
passphrases. `.zed/sftp.json` is in `.gitignore` by default, but this
only protects against `git add` — it does not protect the file from
other distribution channels (shell history, backup tools, screen
sharing, etc.). For real protection, use the env-var syntax below.

**Reference env vars instead of inlining secrets.** Any value starting
with `$` followed by a valid env-var name is resolved from
`process.env` at config load. Supported fields: `password`,
`passphrase`. (Profiles are merged first, then env vars resolved.)

```json
{
  "host": "example.com",
  "username": "deploy",
  "password": "$SFTP_PASSWORD",
  "remotePath": "/var/www/html"
}
```

```bash
SFTP_PASSWORD='...' zed .
```

If the referenced variable is not set, the extension fails to load with
a clear error rather than silently passing an empty password.

**SSH keys are still preferred** over passwords. Passphrases can use
the same `$VAR` form.

**Algorithm choices.** The `algorithms` block lets you constrain the
key-exchange, cipher, host-key, and HMAC algorithms that ssh2 will
accept. The example uses ssh2's preferred order — Curve25519 first,
AES-GCM and ChaCha20 ciphers, ETM HMACs, ED25519 host keys. SHA-1
algorithms (`ssh-rsa`, `hmac-sha1`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`)
are deprecated and are **not** in the example. Only customize this
block if you're connecting to a very old server that doesn't support
the modern algorithms.

### Multiple Profiles

```json
{
  "username": "deploy",
  "privateKeyPath": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
  "profiles": {
    "dev": {
      "host": "dev.example.com",
      "remotePath": "/var/www/dev"
    },
    "production": {
      "host": "prod.example.com",
      "remotePath": "/var/www/html"
    }
  },
  "defaultProfile": "dev"
}
```

### Using Context Path

The `context` field allows you to specify a subdirectory within your workspace as the root for SFTP operations. This is useful for projects where only a specific folder should be synced.

**Example: WordPress Development**

```json
{
  "context": "site/wp-content/",
  "protocol": "sftp",
  "host": "example.com",
  "port": 2222,
  "username": "deploy",
  "remotePath": "/wp-content/",
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "privateKeyPath": "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```

With this configuration:
- **Local**: `site/wp-content/themes/style.css` (in your workspace)
- **Remote**: `/wp-content/themes/style.css` (on the server)

Files outside the `site/wp-content/` directory will be ignored and won't be uploaded.

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Upload on Save

Once configured with `"uploadOnSave": true`, files will automatically upload when you save them in Zed.

### Manual Commands

Use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) to run:

- **SFTP: Upload File** - Upload current file
- **SFTP: Download File** - Download current file
- **SFTP: Upload Folder** - Upload entire folder
- **SFTP: Download Folder** - Download entire folder
- **SFTP: Sync** - Sync local to remote

Each manual command shows a confirmation dialog showing the host and the
remote path before doing anything. Click "Yes, upload" / "Yes, download" /
"Yes, sync" to proceed, or dismiss to cancel. Downloads and sync warn
that they may overwrite existing files.

To disable the confirmation prompts, set `"confirmOperations": false`
in your config. (`uploadOnSave` does not prompt — it has its own opt-in.)

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | - | Connection name |
| `protocol` | string | `sftp` | Protocol: only `sftp` is supported. Setting `ftp` or `ftps` causes config load to fail. |
| `host` | string | **required** | Server hostname |
| `port` | number | `22` | Server port |
| `username` | string | **required** | Username |
| `password` | string | - | Password (not recommended) |
| `privateKeyPath` | string | - | Path to SSH private key |
| `passphrase` | string | - | SSH key passphrase |
| `remotePath` | string | **required** | Remote directory path |
| `localPath` | string | workspace | Local directory path |
| `context` | string | - | Local subdirectory to use as root (e.g., `"site/wp-content/"`) |
| `uploadOnSave` | boolean | `false` | Auto-upload on save |
| `confirmOperations` | boolean | `true` | Prompt before each manual upload/download/sync. Set to `false` to skip. Does not affect `uploadOnSave`. |
| `ignore` | string[] | `[]` | Ignore patterns (glob) |
| `concurrency` | number | `4` | Max concurrent transfers |
| `connectTimeout` | number | `10000` | Connection timeout (ms) |
| `hostKey` | string | - | SHA256 fingerprint of the server's host key (e.g. `"SHA256:pE4q7Y..."`). **Required unless `knownHostsPath` is set or `verifyHostKey` is `false`.** |
| `knownHostsPath` | string | - | Path to an OpenSSH-style `known_hosts` file for host key verification. |
| `verifyHostKey` | boolean | `true` | Set to `false` to explicitly disable host key verification (INSECURE — only for trusted local networks / testing). |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check Node.js is installed**:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be v18 or later
   ```

2. **Check Zed logs**:
   - Open command palette: `Cmd+Shift+P`
   - Run: "zed: open log"
   - Look for SFTP-related errors

3. **Verify configuration**:
   - Ensure `.zed/sftp.json` exists
   - Check JSON syntax is valid
   - Verify credentials are correct

### Connection Issues

1. **Test SSH connection**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@host
   ```

2. **Check SSH key**:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l  # List loaded keys
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Add key if needed
   ```

3. **Verify remote path**:
   ```bash
   sftp user@host
   cd /remote/path  # Should work
   ```

### Files Not Uploading

1. Check `uploadOnSave` is `true` in config
2. Verify file is not in `ignore` patterns
3. Check file permissions on remote server
4. Look for errors in Zed log

## Alternative Solutions (If This Doesn't Work)

If you need SFTP functionality and this extension doesn't work for you:

### 1. Use External Tools

You can use command-line SFTP tools alongside Zed:

- **rsync** - For syncing directories
  ```bash
  rsync -avz --exclude='.git' /local/path/ user@host:/remote/path/
  ```

- **lftp** - For FTP/SFTP operations
  ```bash
  lftp sftp://user@host -e "mirror -R /local/path /remote/path; quit"
  ```

- **sshfs** - Mount remote directory locally
  ```bash
  sshfs user@host:/remote/path /local/mount/point
  ```

### 2. Use Zed Tasks

You can configure Zed tasks to run sync commands. Create a `.zed/tasks.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Upload to Server",
    "command": "rsync",
    "args": ["-avz", "--exclude='.git'", ".", "user@host:/remote/path/"]
  },
  {
    "label": "Download from Server",
    "command": "rsync",
    "args": ["-avz", "user@host:/remote/path/", "."]
  }
]
```

### 3. Use Git-based Deployment

If your remote server supports Git:

```bash
# On your local machine
git push production main

# On the server (post-receive hook)
git --work-tree=/var/www/html --git-dir=/var/repo/site.git checkout -f
```

### 4. File Watchers with Scripts

Use file watchers like `watchman` or `fswatch` to automatically sync on save:

```bash
# Install fswatch
brew install fswatch  # macOS
apt-get install fswatch  # Linux

# Watch and sync
fswatch -o . | xargs -n1 -I{} rsync -avz . user@host:/remote/path/
```

## Configuration Format (Future)

When Zed supports file system extensions, the configuration might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "My Server",
  "protocol": "sftp",
  "host": "example.com",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "user",
  "remotePath": "/var/www/html",
  "uploadOnSave": true,
  "ignore": [
    ".git",
    ".vscode",
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```
